## Dimensionality Reduction

An exploration into dimensionality reduction using PCA, ICA, tSNE and UMAP for NEUR 4700: Advanced Applications of Computational Methods. I also give a presentation on PCA, and created animations using the [Manim](https://www.manim.community/) package in Python created by [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/@3blue1brown).
